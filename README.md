## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox 
- Media queries

### What I learned

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
      body {
        margin: 20px;
      }

      .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        max-width: 400px;
      }

      .image-container {
        width: 100%;
      }

      .image-container img {
        border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
        height: 300px;
      }

      .text {
        width: 90%;
        padding: 0;
        margin: 20px 0 20px 5%;
      }

      .text h1 {
        font-size: 36px;
      }

      .text p {
        width: 93%;
      }

      .current-price {
        font-size: 36px;
      }
    }
```
- This is the media query for screens on or beneath the width of 768px. Major adjustments to the .container div in its flex direction, and font sizes of various of the text in the webpage.

- The width and heights of the elements were set using responsiveness-friendly metrics, mostly percentages.
